# Daily feedback replay triage report - 2026-05-17

Source: 32 simulator bug reports and 1 feedback item submitted from
2026-05-16 07:02:54 UTC through 2026-05-17 06:24:11 UTC.

Workflow used: Intake -> Identify Cards -> Find Similar Patterns ->
Validate Rules -> Attempt Reproduction -> Produce Report.

Report-only constraints honored: no fixes were implemented, no dev servers were
started, no database commands were run, and no reproduction tests were written.
Replay inspection used the read-only replay CLI:
`bun packages/tools/replay-cli/src/cli.ts --replay-id <gameId> --turn <turn>`.

Note: `.ai/skills/lorcana-triage-bug/SKILL.md` was not present in this checkout.
I used the checked-in Lorcana replay-debugging, card lookup, rules, and Nx
workspace workflows instead.

## Replay coverage

| Result | Reports |
| --- | --- |
| Replay pulled successfully | R3-R7, R9-R18, R20-R27, R29-R32 |
| Replay id not found | R1, R2, R8 |
| Invalid turn in report | R19 (`turn: 0`; CLI requires 1-based turns) |
| Replay CLI reconstruction error | R28 (`Failed to apply patches at step 28... pendingCostReductionsByPlayer...`) |

Raw replay traces were captured under `/tmp/lorcana-replay-triage-2026-05-17/`.

## Engineering summary

| Bucket | Reports | Engineering readout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Replay-confirmed likely bugs | R11, R14, R20, R22, R23, R25 | Luisa move-damage pending effects can remain unresolved; Hiram Flaversham can draw without banishing an item; Minnie can miss Support-modified strength targets; Black Cauldron grants permission but the user never gets a play-from-under step; Firefly Swarm allows selecting an unavailable mode and then resolves with no fallback. |
| Text-only likely bugs needing focused repro | R1, R32 | Black Cauldron -> Horned King needs a direct metric test; Sing Together should allow characters with total cost 8 or greater, but the supplied replay turn did not contain the Under the Sea attempt. |
| Likely UI/automation/product work | R2, R3, R5, R7, R9, R18, R29 | Bot choices, disconnect/loss handling, timer state, target clarity, and optional-selection UX are not card-definition fixes without additional UI evidence. |
| Rules or expectation mismatch | R10, R15, R26, R31 | Resist reduces damage before final damage is dealt; Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo says "another character"; Lyle was in discard, not in play; the John Smith report was actually a chain of Support triggers from other characters. |
| Needs clarification or better replay step | R4, R6, R8, R12, R13, R16, R17, R19, R21, R24, R27, R28, R30 | Supplied turn lacked the reported action, the replay was unavailable/invalid, or the trace did not show an accepted failed attempt. |

## Rules constraints used

- CR 1.5.3: a cost must be paid in full.
- CR 1.7.6-1.7.7: illegal actions or illegal choices are undone to the relevant decision point when possible.
- CR 6.1.5.1: for "[A] to [B]" / "If you do" sequences, B does not happen if A cannot be completely performed.
- CR 7.4.3: cards leaving play see other cards leaving play with them for trigger purposes.
- CR 7.7.3.1 and 7.7.4: triggered abilities enter and resolve from the bag after the current effect completes.
- CR 8.8: Resist reduces damage that would be dealt; it does not mean the pre-reduction amount was dealt.
- CR 8.12: Sing Together may use characters with total ink cost N or greater.
- CR 8.13: Support modifies another chosen character's strength this turn.

## Item-by-item triage

| Report | Game id / turn | Cards / area | Replay result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | `game-1778914676533-0qtc4xvro` / 10 | The Black Cauldron, The Horned King - Triumphant Ghoul | Replay not found. Current tests cover Horned King with a manual discard move and Black Cauldron play-from-under separately, but not Black Cauldron incrementing `discard-cards-left`. | Text-only likely bug. Add repro for `032-the-black-cauldron.ts` + `049-the-horned-king-triumphant-ghoul.ts`: putting a discard card under Cauldron should make Horned King quest for +2 lore that turn. |
| R2 | `game-1778915049625-vb6bksq65` / 12 | Bot policy, Tiana, Dale - Ready for His Shot | Replay not found. Report describes bot making legal-but-bad choices and self-destructive challenge lines. | AI/automation follow-up, not a card engine bug without replay evidence. |
| R3 | `mgHL33D2uXC8Jl1xnwGYBu7` / 9 | Disconnect / concede | Replay pulled but no card instances were touched on the submitted turn. | Product/server issue; needs disconnect/timer logs, not a card repro. |
| R4 | `mgI73SJbVrzox34iIpgY0D1` / 16 | Unknown "kill all champs" card | Replay pulled but no card instances were detected on the submitted turn. | Needs clarification: which card killed the characters and which turn/step? |
| R5 | `mgmSe8nSmmA9Y1XfygT7LoD` / 22 | Kristoff's Lute | Replay showed `MOMENT OF INSPIRATION` revealing Maui - Half-Shark, both options legal, and the player chose discard (`choiceIndex: 1`). Existing test covers playing the revealed card. | No engine reproduction. If still repros, inspect simulator UI for disabled/hidden Option 1 when the revealed card is playable. |
| R6 | `mgU_ohnBSpmzi0OpwtQ9jIr` / 13 | The Leviathan, The Return of Hercules | Submitted turn did not include Leviathan or Return of Hercules; it showed a different scry/play flow. | Needs exact turn/step for the Leviathan banish selection failure. |
| R7 | `mgIIWaYi9CzTdE2NDmx3i9Y` / 11 | The Return of Hercules, The Leviathan | Replay showed Return of Hercules playing Leviathan, then Leviathan's optional trigger was declined (`resolveOptional: false`). | Likely UI issue: unclick/deselect path can cancel an optional trigger. Engine accepted the decline. |
| R8 | `game-1778940835595-j22xxbwh7` / 9 | "cheshire" | Replay not found and report text is one word. | Needs clarification: which Cheshire Cat and what failed? |
| R9 | `mgtvSMrf4bPCyBWPnEbD8TU` / 9 | Disconnect / match result | Replay pulled and involved normal card activity; disconnect/result assignment is outside card resolution. | Product/server follow-up. |
| R10 | `mg2iy2iSw8Fwm91-_YjDFvi` / 22 | Scar - Heartless Hunter, Violet Parr - At Wits' End | Replay included Scar and Violet. The report expects Scar to see pre-Resist damage. | Rules expectation mismatch: Resist reduces damage dealt (CR 8.8), so if reduction brings damage to 0, no "2 damage was dealt" trigger should be inferred. |
| R11 | `mg5r9zT5Klev8MmMVIsDCxD` / 19 | Luisa Madrigal - Confident Climber | Replay starts with three pending Luisa move-damage target selections (`pending-action:106/108/110`) with valid damaged-source candidates, but no completed move-damage resolution. | Replay-confirmed likely bug. Repro pending-effect confirmation after selecting a damaged friendly character. |
| R12 | `mgSZZn_DHQso8CQeuxHC5cw` / 9 | Hamm - Piggy Bank | Replay did not show Hamm activation. It showed Hamm among revealed/hand candidates; separate R27 shows Hamm's `LOOSE CHANGE` activation succeeds. | No reproduction from supplied turn. Ask for the turn where Hamm was dry/in play and the exert option was unavailable. |
| R13 | `mgPcy_jnwXzmyjvw_nMsbHi` / 19 | Mirabel Madrigal - Curious Child | Replay showed Mirabel played and the trigger entered the bag, but the submitted move declined it (`resolveOptional: false`) rather than selecting a song. | Likely UI/selection issue, not engine-confirmed. Need browser or move trace where a song was selected and confirm stayed disabled. |
| R14 | `mgSfkDDPNq5wFBY2j00Ad8I` / 11 | Luisa Madrigal - Confident Climber | Replay showed a Luisa move-damage pending selection with valid candidates that persisted while later actions proceeded. | Same actionable family as R11: pending move-damage confirmation/priority handling. |
| R15 | `mgROtD79El-bAfC4PoFxzMt` / 15 | Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo | Replay showed Bibbidi returning Chip - Quick Thinker, then the follow-up play candidate excluded Chip and offered Prince John. | Rules expectation mismatch: Bibbidi says "another character"; current definition uses `excludeChosenCard: true`. There may also be stale-effect retry UX because the trace repeats the old return-to-hand effect id. |
| R16 | `mgCvA1tLoxCH6UrLyd3dp5d` / 10 | Unknown "look at top 3 and reveal" effect | Replay involved several cards but the report does not name the source. The submitted turn did not isolate a failed reveal. | Needs source card name or exact step. |
| R17 | `mg60BUktDMpzo8RV3qDKbNC` / 12 | "Resolve effect", Luisa Madrigal | Replay touched Firefly Swarm, Julieta's Arepas, Isabela, and Luisa - No Pressure, not Luisa - Confident Climber. | Needs clarification. Could be related to generic pending-effect UX, but this replay does not confirm the Luisa move-damage bug. |
| R18 | `mgLRYqwzW5Evso46iNsA8ML` / 14 | Hades - Looking for a Deal | Replay included Hades and target-choice effects, but the complaint is target clarity. | UI clarity follow-up: highlight/label Hades' chosen character for draw-2 / bottom-deck resolution. |
| R19 | `mgX28M_HsdDloODk4wrE7G-` / 0 | Cheshire Cat - Inexplicable | CLI rejected turn 0. A turn-1 pull did not include Cheshire Cat. | Needs valid 1-based turn. Potential test should cover choosing move amount 1 for `up to 2` move-damage, but replay did not confirm. |
| R20 | `mg_gfqu96DSSDzYKb17tgQn` / 9 | Hiram Flaversham - Toymaker | Replay confirmed Hiram's `ARTIFICER` resolved with `resolveOptional: true`, no item target, and still drew 2 cards. | Replay-confirmed bug. Sequential effect must not draw unless an item was banished. |
| R21 | `mgWrB2qlE8SedkC5V3lTo1P` / 9 | Mirabel Madrigal - Curious Child | Replay showed Mirabel's trigger entering the bag, then two declined resolves (`resolveOptional: false`). | Same as R13: likely UI/selection friction, but no accepted failed reveal attempt in replay. |
| R22 | `mg3rYLKTeMuVKyHnD_rsIQF` / 11 | Minnie Mouse - Sweetheart Princess, Support | Replay showed Support boosts applied, then Minnie `BYE BYE, NOW` resolved with no input/no banish. | Replay-confirmed likely bug. Target analysis for Minnie's exerted strength >= 5 filter should use current strength after Support. |
| R23 | `mg_65tnvUVK6_K2hayvY0_S` / 15 | The Black Cauldron | Replay showed `RISE AND JOIN ME!` adding `playFromUnderPermissions`, then the player passed with the character still under Cauldron and the permission removed at turn start. | Replay-confirmed likely simulator/available-moves bug: play-from-under permission exists but the player did not get/complete the play action. |
| R24 | `mgihdxdTZ6LLUNYi_vwbXmq` / 13 | Wind-Up Frog - Sid's Toy | Submitted turn did not show Wind-Up Frog being played after a Toy banish. | Needs exact failed play step. Existing card definition has a hand-zone static cost reduction keyed to Toy characters banished this turn. |
| R25 | `mgihdxdTZ6LLUNYi_vwbXmq` / 19 | Firefly Swarm | Replay confirmed the player chose option 2; condition was false, so the card resolved with no target/no banish and did not fall back to option 1. | Replay-confirmed rules/UX bug. If an unavailable mode is chosen, CR 1.7.6-1.7.7 imply undoing to the choice point when possible. Also labels should distinguish option 1 vs option 2. |
| R26 | `mgfygMiKLn39tocvUbWjjzE` / 11 | Lyle Tiberius Rourke - Adventurer for Hire | Replay shows Lyle `j7` in discard, not in play, and no `DIRTY TRICKS` end-turn trigger. | Rules/state mismatch. Need a replay where Lyle is in play at end of turn after 2+ cards enter that player's discard. |
| R27 | `mgb8SeNGg9rcir5ILzWGLgB` / 10 | Sid Phillips - Toy Surgeon, Hamm | Replay showed Sid banishing Hamm and `DOUBLE PRIZES!` granting 2 lore. The opponent's follow-up banish selection was pending; the trace slice did not confirm a second Toy banish before Sid changed zones. | Needs narrower follow-up. Rule constraint: CR 7.4.3 says simultaneous leaving-play triggers should see other cards leaving with the source. Add a repro if two Toy characters are banished in the same event while Sid also leaves. |
| R28 | `mgEr_VZlbwwu1xFD75KGIS0` / 11 | Luisa Madrigal - Confident Climber | Replay CLI could not reconstruct the pre-turn state because patch application failed on `pendingCostReductionsByPlayer`. | Needs replay CLI/data repair or a different persisted replay. Treat as same reported family as R11/R14 until confirmed. |
| R29 | `mgGGMZfOq9vKYX5YZd_MwY-` / 9 | Timer | Replay pulled normal card activity; timer defaulting to out-of-time is not card resolution. | Product/server timer-state follow-up. |
| R30 | `mgbweqYdPFRJWEN--60J0ve` / 3 | Mirabel Madrigal - Curious Child | Replay showed Mirabel already in play and questing; it did not show playing Mirabel or attempting the reveal trigger on the submitted turn. | Needs exact play turn/step. |
| R31 | `mgul22S_js_GYSJqQevowMP` / 17 | John Smith / Support | Replay did not touch John Smith. It showed a chain of Support triggers from other characters, plus Ranger Plane targeting a strength-10 character. | Likely card identity mismatch. Need the exact John Smith printing and step; current `John Smith - Skillful Explorer` is vanilla. |
| R32 | `mgUHtYhWrVFQd5P3zeL2GmY` / 12 | Under the Sea, Sing Together | Replay turn did not include Under the Sea; it showed a different song played with a single singer. | Text-only likely bug if reproducible: CR 8.12 allows total cost N or greater, so cost 5 + 6 should satisfy Sing Together 8. Need exact failed action/turn for an availability repro. |

## Clarification questions

1. R4 / `mgI73SJbVrzox34iIpgY0D1`: which card killed the characters, and on which turn/step?
2. R6 / `mgU_ohnBSpmzi0OpwtQ9jIr`: which turn contains the Leviathan play and failed opposing-character selection?
3. R8 / `game-1778940835595-j22xxbwh7`: which Cheshire Cat printing and effect failed?
4. R12 / `mgSZZn_DHQso8CQeuxHC5cw`: was Hamm dry and in play when the exert option was missing?
5. R16 / `mgCvA1tLoxCH6UrLyd3dp5d`: which card had the "look at top 3 and reveal" effect?
6. R19 / `mgX28M_HsdDloODk4wrE7G-`: provide a 1-based turn number for the Cheshire Cat Boost/move-damage issue.
7. R24 / `mgihdxdTZ6LLUNYi_vwbXmq`: which step attempted to play Wind-Up Frog after a Toy was banished?
8. R31 / `mgul22S_js_GYSJqQevowMP`: which John Smith printing was in play?
9. R32 / `mgUHtYhWrVFQd5P3zeL2GmY`: which turn contains the failed Under the Sea Sing Together attempt?

## Suggested repro tests for engineering assignment

- Black Cauldron + Horned King: activating `THE CAULDRON CALLS` should increment the discard-left metric used by Horned King's lore static.
- Luisa pending effect: selecting a valid damaged friendly character should enable/complete the move-damage effect and not leave stale pending selections.
- Hiram Flaversham: accepting `ARTIFICER` with no friendly item should not draw cards; with an item, it must banish the item before drawing.
- Minnie Sweetheart Princess: Support-modified current strength should satisfy the 5+ target filter for `BYE BYE, NOW`.
- Black Cauldron play-from-under: after `RISE AND JOIN ME!`, available moves should include playable characters under that item until the permission expires.
- Firefly Swarm: option 2 should be unavailable or undoable when fewer than 2 other cards entered discard this turn.
- Sing Together: Under the Sea should be singable with multiple characters whose total ink cost is 8 or greater.

## Verification

- `pnpm nx show projects --json` passed.
- Replay CLI sweep completed for all supplied bug-report game ids/turns where the turn was valid.
- Card lookup used `packages/lorcana/lorcana-cards/src/cards/similarity.ts` for named cards and exact file paths.
- No tests were run and no code was changed beyond this report, per the report-only instruction.
