/**
 * Scry effect - Look at top cards and distribute to destinations
 *
 * Replaces the old LookAtCardsEffect with a declarative destinations array.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * 1. Declarative: Describes WHAT happens, not HOW
 * 2. Composable: Multiple independent selections from same pool
 * 3. Parser-friendly: Can be constructed from natural language
 *
 * @example "Look at top 4, reveal a character, put into hand, rest on bottom"
 * @example "Look at top 5, reveal up to 1 Madrigal AND up to 1 song, put in hand"
