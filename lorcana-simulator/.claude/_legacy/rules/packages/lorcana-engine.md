# Lorcana Engine Rules

## Overview

The lorcana-engine package implements Disney Lorcana TCG using the @tcg/core framework. It defines Lorcana-specific zones, moves, phases, and win conditions.

## Lorcana-Specific Concepts

### Ink System

- Cards can be placed into the **inkwell** as resources
- Inkable cards have `inkable: true`
- Ink is spent to play cards

### Zones

| Zone      | Description          |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| `deck`    | Draw pile (60 cards) |
| `hand`    | Cards in hand        |
| `play`    | Characters in play   |
| `inkwell` | Ink resources        |
| `discard` | Discarded cards      |

### Card States

```typescript
type LorcanaCardState = {
  damage: number; // Damage taken
  canQuest: boolean; // Can quest this turn
  exerted: boolean; // Tapped/exhausted
};
```

## Core Moves

### Play Card

Play a card from hand by paying ink cost:

- Check ink in inkwell >= card cost
- Move card to play zone
- Character cannot quest/challenge same turn (unless Rush)

### Quest

Exert a character to gain lore:

- Character must be ready (not exerted)
- Character must be able to quest
- Gain lore equal to character's lore value

### Challenge

Exert a character to attack an opponent's exerted character:

- Your character must be ready
- Target must be exerted
- Both deal damage equal to strength
- Characters at or above willpower are banished

### Put Card Into Inkwell

Add a card to inkwell as resource:

- Card must be in hand
- Card must be inkable
- Once per turn limit

## Turn Flow

```
Ready Phase → Set Phase → Draw Phase → Main Phase → End Phase
```

1. **Ready Phase**: Ready all exerted cards
2. **Set Phase**: First player skips draw on turn 1
3. **Draw Phase**: Draw one card
4. **Main Phase**: Play cards, quest, challenge
5. **End Phase**: End of turn triggers

## Win Condition

**Lore Victory**: First player to reach 20 lore wins.

```typescript
const loreVictory: WinCondition = {
  check: (state) => {
    for (const player of state.players) {
      if (player.lore >= 20) {
        return { winner: player.id };
      }
    }
    return null;
  },
};
```

## Testing

Use LorcanaTestEngine for Lorcana-specific tests:

```typescript
import { LorcanaTestEngine, PLAYER_ONE, PLAYER_TWO } from "@tcg/lorcana/testing";

// Create test engine with initial state for each player
const engine = new LorcanaTestEngine(
  { hand: 7, deck: 53 }, // Player one state
  { hand: 7, deck: 53 }, // Player two state
  { skipPreGame: true, seed: "test-seed" }, // Options
);

// Access game state
const state = engine.getState();

// Execute moves
engine.changeActivePlayer(PLAYER_ONE);
engine.quest(characterId);
engine.passTurn();

// Create test characters with stats
const charId = engine.createCharacterInPlay(PLAYER_ONE, {
  strength: 5,
  willpower: 7,
});
```

## Extending

When adding new moves or abilities:

1. Define in appropriate `moves/` subdirectory
2. Add to move registry in `game-definition/index.ts`
3. Write tests following TDD
4. Update type definitions if needed
