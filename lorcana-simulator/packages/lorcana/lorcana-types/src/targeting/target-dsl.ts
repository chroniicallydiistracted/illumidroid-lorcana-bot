 * @typeParam TContext - Type of context references
 *
 * @example Basic character targeting
 * ```typescript
 * const target: TargetDSL = {
 *   selector: "chosen",
 *   count: 1,
 *   owner: "opponent",
 *   zones: ["play"],
 *   cardTypes: ["character"]
 * };

 *
 * @example Targeting with filters
 * ```typescript
 * const target: TargetDSL = {
 *   selector: "all",
 *   owner: "any",
 *   zones: ["play"],
 *   filter: { type: "creature", tapped: true }
