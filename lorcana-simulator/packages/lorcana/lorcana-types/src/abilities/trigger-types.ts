/**
 * Trigger Types for Lorcana Abilities
 *
 * Defines when triggered abilities activate. Lorcana uses three timing words:
 * - "When" - triggers once when event occurs
 * - "Whenever" - triggers each time event occurs
 * - "At" - triggers at a specific game phase
 *
 * The trigger system uses the same targeting DSL as the rest of the codebase
 * to filter what causes a trigger to fire.
 *
 * @example "When you play this character, draw 2 cards"
 * ```typescript
 * { event: "play", timing: "when", on: "SELF" }
 * ```
 *
 * @example "Whenever this character quests, gain 1 lore"
 * ```typescript
 * { event: "quest", timing: "whenever", on: "SELF" }
 * ```
 *
 * @example "Whenever you play a character, draw a card"
 * ```typescript
 * { event: "play", timing: "whenever", on: { controller: "you", cardType: "character" } }
 * ```
