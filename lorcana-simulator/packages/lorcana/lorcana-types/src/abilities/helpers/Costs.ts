/**
 * Cost Helpers for Lorcana Abilities
 *
 * Provides a fluent API for building cost definitions.
 * These helpers make it easy to construct common cost patterns.

 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const cost = Costs.Ink(2);
 * const cost = Costs.Exert();
 * const cost = Costs.Combined(Costs.Ink(1), Costs.Exert());
 * ```
